# RECO_ggH

STEP:1 This code is generated by script for cmssw_7_6_1, we want to reconstruct everything again in this new version, your computation power is highly appreciated, since we want to reconstruct all these samples.

cmsrel CMSSW_7_6_1

cd CMSSW_7_6_1/src

cmsenv

git clone everything in this folder.

You need to modify input file names corresponding to which simulated sample you want to use, in this case code is on ggH(125GeV)->aa(19GeV)->2mu2tau, So Change to

1. ggH(750)->aa(19)->2mu2tau

2.ggH(750)->aa(9)->2mu2tau

3.ggH(300)->aa(19)->2mu2tau

4.ggH(300)->aa(9)-> 2mu2tau

5. ggH(125)->aa(9)->2mu2tau

STEP2: You shuold either able to get datasets(heavyHiggs_300_light_9_2mu2tau_sim) labeled "sim" in my eos space, mshi, or from UC Davis Cern computer; or I may delete it to save space(very likely), you need to do simulation from dataset using datasets labeled "sample". https://github.com/MengyaoShi/MCGeneration first, and go to STEP1
